          <h2>NITK Beach</h2>
          <p>NITK Beach is a serene and scenic beach located near the National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK) in Surathkal, Mangalore, Karnataka, India.</p>
          <p>One of the unique features of NITK Beach is the lighthouse located nearby, which offers a panoramic view of the coastline.</p>
          <p>As it's close to the NITK campus, the beach is a popular hangout spot for students looking to unwind after classes or spend time with friends. </p>
          
          <h3>1. Morning Is A Great Time To Visit</h3>
          <p>Visiting NITK Beach in the early morning offers a serene and peaceful experience, as the beach is often quiet, with only the gentle sounds of waves and birds to accompany you. It’s a perfect time to enjoy a meditative stroll along the shore.</p>
          <p>The morning light bathes the beach in a soft, golden glow, creating a tranquil atmosphere that feels almost magical. Watching the sunrise over the horizon with the cool morning breeze is a refreshing way to start your day.</p>
          <p>Mornings at NITK Beach offer a unique charm as the first rays of sunlight gently illuminate the waves and rocky outcrops. It’s a fantastic time for photographers to capture the beach in its natural beauty.</p>
          <p>With cooler temperatures and a fresh coastal breeze, morning is an excellent time for activities like yoga or jogging along the beach, providing a perfect, rejuvenating start to your day.</p>
